I was planning on having the information which can be stored in the database appear on the homepage but unfortunately I could not get that
working. I also couldn't call the information about the registered users back as to use that to log in. So the users which I have are:

Username/Password
ian/ian123
steve/steve123
dave/dave123
keith/keith123
